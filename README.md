## CarPricePrediction

### üìå Problem Description

A Chinese automobile company wants to enter the US market by setting up local manufacturing. To compete with US and European brands, they hired a consulting firm to analyze car pricing factors in the American market.

# Business Goals:

-Identify significant factors that affect car prices.

-Determine how well these variables explain price variations.

-Use insights to optimize car design and business strategy.

-Build a model to understand pricing dynamics in the new market.
